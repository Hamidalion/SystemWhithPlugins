##### Purpose #####

The tasks was executed using dotnet core.
The tasks were completed in full, including additional tasks.

### To start ###
To start working with the application, you need to download it from this repository. The executable `* .exe` file is located at  `lab-02\lab-file-storage\src\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\.`
The launch is carried out from under the command line.
After entering the executable file, you must enter the username and password separated by spaces. For example `\ path_to_app \ name_app.exe LittlePony95 12345`. If the specified account does not exist, the program will offer to create one. Symbols should not be used when creating a new login, as this will create problems when creating a repository name in the file system. When creating an account, a repository with the specified name will be created in the program directory.
The following commands will be available for the storage operation.

1. "file upload"
2. "file download"
3. "file move"
4. "file remove"
